[Ritik - 7th April '19]

1. Add feature to Display a message when the API's don't return any result like "Sorry.. Use some other keywords"

2. Specifically tell me what buttons to keep. Like in pintrest when you hover you get to see the buttons appear which say 
   (i)  "Save"
   (ii) Beside "Save" Button there is a dropdown list of already created albums by user
   (iii)In bottom left (in some cover images) there is some link for original source of cover photo
   (iv) In right bottom there is another button too.
   So tell me which buttons you want to keep and where
   Add those buttons in the AdobeXD link itself(which you shared on slack)
   I'll code for those buttons(css).. we can add interactivity on them later on(can code for JS interactivity if you allow me to.)

3. Please answer/Instruct me in this Text file only (by appending below) with your name and date (as i did).
   Don't laugh . Will work in the structered way. 

4. I have added the feature for like pintrest layout. its working fine when you resize the browser also(responsive). try it.
   If you want anything else or some edit in this. Mention it below.

5. Abhi i forgot to make branch. I worked on master only. kalse i'll make branch and work on it.
